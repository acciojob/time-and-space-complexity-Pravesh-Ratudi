	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time it takes to execute an algorithm. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run. It is often expressed in terms of big O notation, such as <b>Space Complexity</b> is O(n).</p>
